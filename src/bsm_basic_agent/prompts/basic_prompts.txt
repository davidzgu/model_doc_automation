"Read ONLY the first 5 rows from file in \n\n"
"Path:{path}\n\n"
"using csv_loader tool. After the data is successfully read from the file, "
"then calculate the Black-Scholes-Merton option price for ALL data points in ONE call. "
"\n\n"
"IMPORTANT: Use batch_bsm_calculator tool with the JSON data returned by csv_loader. "
"DO NOT call bsm_calculator multiple times for each row. "
"The batch_bsm_calculator will efficiently process all rows at once and return a formatted table."
"\n\n"
"Expected workflow:\n"
"1. Call csv_loader to read the CSV file\n"
"2. Pass the JSON result directly to batch_bsm_calculator\n"
"3. Display the markdown table returned by batch_bsm_calculator"
